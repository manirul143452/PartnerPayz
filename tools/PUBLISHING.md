# Publishing to GitHub

Follow these steps to publish this project to your GitHub account:

## Prerequisites

1. Install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one: https://github.com/join

## Steps to Publish

1. Open a terminal/command prompt in this folder

2. Initialize the Git repository:
   ```
   git init
   ```

3. Add all files to Git:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

4. Commit the changes:
   ```

   ```

5. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name the repository "partnerpayze"
   - Keep it public
   - Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

6. Connect your local repository to GitHub:

   git remote add origin https://github.com/manirul143452/partnerpayze.git
   ```

7. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   (If you're using an older version of Git, you might need to use `master` instead of `main`)

8. If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password or personal access token
